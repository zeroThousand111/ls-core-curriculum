Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:

class Card
  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end
end

For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the card, e.g., "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

Examples:

cards = [Card.new(2, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(10, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')]
puts cards
puts cards.min == Card.new(2, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(5, 'Hearts')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')

cards = [Card.new(4, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(4, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(10, 'Clubs')]
puts cards.min.rank == 4
puts cards.max == Card.new(10, 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(7, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Spades')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(7, 'Diamonds')
puts cards.max.rank == 'Jack'

cards = [Card.new(8, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(8, 'Clubs'),
         Card.new(8, 'Spades')]
puts cards.min.rank == 8
puts cards.max.rank == 8

Output:
2 of Hearts
10 of Diamonds
Ace of Clubs
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true

Approach/Algorithm
This exercise doesn't expect you to define a #min or #max method in the Card class. It wants you to update the class so that Enumerable#min and Enumerable#max work when applied to an Array of Card objects.

Hint
Investigate the Comparable module.

class Card
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end

  def <=>(other_card)
    if convert_rank(rank) > convert_rank(other_card.rank)
      1
    elsif convert_rank(rank) < convert_rank(other_card.rank)
      -1
    elsif convert_rank(rank) == convert_rank(other_card.rank)
      0
    else
      nil
    end
  end

  private

  def convert_rank(rank)
    case rank
    when 'Jack' then 11
    when 'Queen' then 12
    when 'King' then 13
    when 'Ace' then 14
    else
      rank
    end
  end
