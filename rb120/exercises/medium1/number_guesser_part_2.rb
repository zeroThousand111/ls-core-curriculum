=begin
In the previous exercise, you wrote a number guessing game that determines a secret number between 1 and 100, and gives the user 7 opportunities to guess the number.

Update your solution to accept a low and high value when you create a GuessingGame object, and use those values to compute a secret number for the game. You should also change the number of guesses allowed so the user can always win if she uses a good strategy. You can compute the number of guesses with:

Math.log2(size_of_range).to_i + 1

Examples:

---

game = GuessingGame.new(501, 1500)
game.play

You have 10 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 104
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1000
Your guess is too low.

You have 9 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1250
Your guess is too low.

You have 8 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1375
Your guess is too high.

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 80
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1312
Your guess is too low.

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1343
Your guess is too low.

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1359
Your guess is too high.

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1351
Your guess is too low.

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1355
That's the number!

You won!

Note that a game object should start a new game with a new number to guess with each call to #play.
