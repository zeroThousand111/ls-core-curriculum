# Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:

class Card
  include Comparable
  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end

  def to_s
    "#{rank} of #{suit}"
  end

  protected
  def <=>(other)
    self.interpret_rank <=> other.interpret_rank
  end

  def interpret_rank
    case rank
    when 2..10 then rank
    when 'Jack' then 11
    when 'Queen' then 12
    when 'King' then 13
    when 'Ace' then 14
    end
  end
end

For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the card, e.g., "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

Examples:
=end

cards = [Card.new(2, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(10, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')]
puts cards
puts cards.min == Card.new(2, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(5, 'Hearts')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')

cards = [Card.new(4, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(4, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(10, 'Clubs')]
puts cards.min.rank == 4
puts cards.max == Card.new(10, 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(7, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Spades')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(7, 'Diamonds')
puts cards.max.rank == 'Jack'

cards = [Card.new(8, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(8, 'Clubs'),
         Card.new(8, 'Spades')]
puts cards.min.rank == 8
puts cards.max.rank == 8
