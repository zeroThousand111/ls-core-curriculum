    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn
      <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em>
      class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>.
      I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
    </p>

    <p class="more-text">
      There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML
      &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter
      color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and
      a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
    </p>

    <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
      This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as
      an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline
      the entire paragraph.
    </p>
