    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my website!  It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>.  I'm learning a lot!  Why don't you join me?</p>

    <p class="additional-paragraph">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML & CSS.  When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will accomplish that.</p>

    <p class="additional-paragraph" id="last-paragraph">This is the final paragraph.  It also uses the "class" attribute as well as an "id" attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
  </body>
