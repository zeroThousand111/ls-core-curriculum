each_cons (Part 1)
The Enumerable#each_cons method iterates over the members of a collection taking each sequence of n consecutive elements at a time and passing them to the associated block for processing. It then returns a value of nil.

Write a method called each_cons that behaves similarly for Arrays, taking the elements 2 at a time. The method should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each consecutive pair of elements to the block, and return nil.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #reduce, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:

hash = {}
result = each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
result == nil
hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
result = each_cons([]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
hash == {}
result == nil

hash = {}
result = each_cons(['a', 'b']) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
hash == {'a' => 'b'}
result == nil

=end

# My solution

def each_cons(array)
  index = 1
  until index >= array.size
    yield(array[index - 1], array[index])
    index += 1
  end

  nil
end

# LS Solution

def each_cons(array)
  array.each_with_index do |item, index|
    break if index + 1 >= array.size
    yield(item, array[index + 1])
  end
  nil
end

hash = {}
result = each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p result == nil
p hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
result = each_cons([]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {}
p result == nil

hash = {}
result = each_cons(['a', 'b']) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {'a' => 'b'}
p result == nil

Discussion
The hardest part of this exercise is trying to decide when to stop iterating. Obviously, we can't simply iterate over the entire Array, since there are no elements with which to pair the last element if we did. Instead, we need to stop when the current element is the last element, which we can detect by comparing the value of index + 1 against the Array size.
