The Enumerable#each_with_object method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element and an arbitrary object (usually a collection) to the associated block. The value returned by the block is not used. The object that is passed to the block is defined as an argument to each_with_object; with each iteration, this object may be updated by the block. When iteration is complete, the final value of the object is returned.

Write a method called each_with_object that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array and an object of some sort as an argument, and a block. It should yield each element and the object to the block. each_with_object should return the final value of the object.

If the Array is empty, each_with_object should return the original object passed as its second argument.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_index, #reduce, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:

result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], []) do |value, list|
  list << value**2
end
result == [1, 9, 25]

result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], []) do |value, list|
  list << (1..value).to_a
end
result == [[1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]

result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], {}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value] = value**2
end
result == { 1 => 1, 3 => 9, 5 => 25 }

result = each_with_object([], {}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value] = value * 2
end
result == {}
